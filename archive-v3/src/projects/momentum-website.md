I built and designed a reactive website with for [Texas Momentum](https://texasmomentum.org), a student organization at UT Austin that connects talented student engineers to ambitious student founders. The website is built with React.js and is hosted on Netlify. Design inspiration from [MEG Consulting](https://www.megconsulting.org/) at UMich.
