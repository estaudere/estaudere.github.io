    I'm currently an undergrad at UT Austin studying computer science with a focus on
    machine learning and its applications in everything from autonomous systems to large generative
    models.

<p class="mb-5 text-lg">
    In the past, I've worked on a variety of research projects ranging from differentiable
    retrieval systems to language agents to foundation multimodal models, as well as 
    software engineering stints at places like Citibank. I also write.

    So, you could call me a machine learning researcher, a software engineer, or a writer, but
    I'm really just a curious person who likes to learn and build things. I'm also helping to
    cultivate a community of creative thinkers on campus with 
    <a class="underline underline-offset-4" href="https://txmomentum.org">Texas Momentum</a> and 
    Texas Venture Group (coming soon!).
