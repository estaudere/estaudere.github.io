<p class="mb-5 text-lg">
    I'm currently an undergrad at UT Austin studying computer science with a focus on
    machine learning and its applications in everything from autonomous systems to large generative
    models.
</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-lg">
    My current interests are better retrieval, for agents and over large multimodal corpuses, and
    control of robotic and language agents. I've had software engineering stints at places like 
    CitiBank. I'm drawn to complex systems — systems which are more than the sum of their parts — 
    and building systems that can navigate such spaces.
</p>
<p class="mb-5 text-lg">
    I'm really just a curious person who likes to learn and build things. I'm also helping to
    cultivate a community of creative thinkers on campus with 
    <a class="link" href="https://txmomentum.org">Texas Momentum</a> and 
    Texas Venture Group (coming soon!).
</p>

    I also write — in a past life, I did comms and journalism (you can find some of my published 
    pieces scattered about the internet as well as quotes from me in places like The New Republic 
    and Reuters), and I wrote poems, fiction, and prose. Now, I mostly write about tech and the
    future.
